# CSS stylesheet:

1) stylesheet.css - This is used for styling the controls and layout of the JavaFX GUI.


# Compile and run the application from the IDE:

In the game window enter a two character string (first a letter and then a number - these correspond to the row and column of the game table) and press the <Fire> button. Continue until the game is over when all the battleships are hit.

Then, there is an option to reset the game and play again, if you choose to.
